# EOH2024

**Hey! Here's the instructions to run this thing:**
If the site is open and looks good, skip steps 1-4.
1. Go to the terminal
    - If there isn't a bar on the bottom,  use ctrl+shift+~
    - You should see Problems | Output | Debug Console | Terminal | Ports; go to Terminal
    - Select the arrow next to the + on the top right corner of the bar, then select Ubuntu(WSL)
2. Type in "streamlit run cartoon.py" and hit enter
    - if it hits you with "gio: http://localhost:8502: Operation not supported", don't worry about it!
3. Ctrl+click on local URL -- upon startup it'll take a minute (literally) to load, it'll be faster after that
4. Any errors will show up on ths site after you start it up. Call or text me (you should have my number) if that happens

5. It'll give visitors an emotion; you can click the take photo button to take their photo. This will happen three times.
6. This is where the generation happens! It'll take a little bit. I'll try to set things up so that users can see a little of what's going on. In the terminal, you'll see the prompts that the image-to-text model generated for the text-to-image model. Feel free to share some of what it says with the viewers while it's working! Try to keep them engaged and excited!
7. It'll generate their output image. This will not be saved!! How to send it to them:
 - Open the EOH Photo Requests google form
 - Have them fill out their email
 - *You* click add file, drag and drop the photo from the application's tab into the google form's, and hit submit.
8. I'll handle sending them out on my end. Good luck! You got this <3
